### "Post-quantum digital signature based on the Stribog hash-function"

This repository is my graduate work.

I will follow next steps:
1. Classic Stribog (GOST 34.11-2018)
2. **Stribog with increased hash-length**
3. Digital signature, which can be:
   - Classic ECDSA
   - ECDSA with increased key length
   - Some existing post-quantum DS algorithm
   - Absolutely new post-quantum DS algorithm (*who knows*)
